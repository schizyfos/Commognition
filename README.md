I am creating the 'Book without language' - https://dennikn.sk/blog/4203865/hippasos/, supposing that by listening to it, one can learn/create the impossible new, non-dualist language which the truth and ethics be one.

A Socratic dialogue on mathematics, by Alfréd Rényi, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/13265932B04BE25A51D3944209C3AA08/S0008439500052346a.pdf/socratic_dialogue_on_mathematics.pdf 

# tldr
"Why do you think, Socrates, that this method of thinking and arguing can be used only for the study of numbers and geometric forms? Why do you not try to convince your fellow-citizens to apply the same high logical standards in every other field, for instance in philosophy and politics; in discussing the problems of everyday private and public life?" From that time, this is what I have always tried to do".

(1) Theorizing physics is inspiring for the humanities.
Because it involves an excellent command of the language of axiomatic theorizing, mathematics. The team is reaching its Gödelian proof limits (Hawking, https://www.hawking.org.uk/in-words/lectures/godel-and-the-end-of-physics).
Summary: Gödelian incompleteness of proof is a good uncertainty framework under which axiomatic theories work consistently.

(2) Thanks to this, it comes up with a practical idea that overcomes these limitations - to search for connections in disconnected mathematical formalisms. Through this search, a completely new heuristic knowledge emerges unexpectedly (Witten, https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sns/files/KyotoComemorativeLecture.pdf).
Summary: Mathematics defines the boundaries of physical intuitionism (Reference).

(3) It is reasonable to hold onto this reference even when theorizing AI.
Individual agentic approach with LLMs are not enough for this (Bengio, https://lawzero.org/en/research).
Summary: Reference allows us to remain on the field of science even in everyday life (Everyday Life).

(4) This brings us closer to the real feasibility of Rényi's dream (Rényi):
tldr
"Of course, I then asked myself whether the rules used in the study of numbers and shapes could not be used outside of mathematics as well, whether it would not be worth trying to convince people to have the same demands on their own thinking as mathematicians, so that a similar precision of thinking would dominate philosophy, politics and everyday life in general. You see, that's what I've been trying to do ever since."

Summary: This (1-4) is a procedure for restoring the broken pluralism in which we live. Otherwise, our life will turn into a paradox of self-reference, in which we are loosing ourselves (Barber's Paradox, In a small town, there is only one barber who shaves the very men in town who don't shave themselves. Does the barber shave himself? He should shave himself exactly when he won't shave himself).
