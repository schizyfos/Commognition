# Commognition
I am creating the 'Book without language' - https://dennikn.sk/blog/4203865/hippasos/. 

Thereby I am trying to understand the meaninglessness/impossibility of private language by overcoming it.

I suppose that by listening to it one can learn the new language enactively via commognition, i.e. cognition as communication with oneself.
