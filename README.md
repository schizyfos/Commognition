# Commognition
I am creating an open reflective tool on youtube - https://dennikn.sk/blog/4203865/hippasos/ 

It's a playlist of Ukrainian IDM songs. 

I suppose that by listening to it (co-creation) one can learn the pattern of the process of emergence of the new via commognition, i.e. cognition as communication with oneself - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-024-00217-5.
