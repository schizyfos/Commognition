I have created an open reflection tool on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrStYA3bqS4EEUMUvmVgrHZHGvndp2qHP&jct=dr5a8SXK1x1JcCxQhwl1xQ. It's a playlist of Ukrainian IDM songs. I suppose that by listening to it (co-creation) one can learn the smallest unit of value and expertize as one process-concept. A fractal (of the surface to volume entanglement/correspondence) from which and only from which one can proceed with AGI programming. For then it will contain all the reflectivity that precedes it - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-024-00217-5.
