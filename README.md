# Commognition
I am creating the 'Book without language' - https://dennikn.sk/blog/4203865/hippasos/. 
I suppose that by listening to it one can learn/create the impossible new, non-dualist language which the truth and ethics be one.

A Socratic dialogue on mathematics, by Alfréd Rényi, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/13265932B04BE25A51D3944209C3AA08/S0008439500052346a.pdf/socratic_dialogue_on_mathematics.pdf "Why do you think, Socrates, that this method of thinking and arguing can be used only for the study of numbers and geometric forms? Why do you not try to convince your fellow-citizens to apply the same high logical standards in every other field, for instance in philosophy and politics; in discussing the problems of everyday private and public life?" From that time, this is what I have always tried to do".
